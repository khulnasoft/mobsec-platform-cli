# MobSec CLI

## Overview

The MobSec CLI is a tool that allows users to interact with the MobSec Platform. It is a command line interface that allows users to perform a variety of tasks, including:

* Uploading Applications to MobSec Platform.
* Accessing assessment data.
* Managing your MobSec Organization including sending invitations.

## User's Guide

### Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The following is needed to use the mobsec-cli:

* A valid MobSec Platform account.
* A valid MobSec Platform API token.  Instructions on how to acquire this can be found in the MobSec support center document [Creating an API Bearer Token in Platform](https://support.khulnasoft.com/hc/en-us/articles/7499657262093-Creating-an-API-Bearer-Token-in-Platform) 
* If you are using a single tenant deployment of MobSec Platform, you will need to specify the URLs of your deployment during configuration.  Please be sure to have the following URLs available:
  * The URL of your MobSec Platform REST API.  This is the URL that you will use to access the MobSec Platform API.  This URL will be in the format of `lab-api.<tenant>.khulnasoft.com`.
  * The URL of your MobSec Graph API.  This is the URL that you will use to access the MobSec Graph API.  This URL will be in the format of `api.<tenant>.khulnasoft.com`.
  * The URL of your MobSec Platform UI.  This is the URL that you will use to access the MobSec Platform UI.  This URL will be in the format of `app.<tenant>.khulnasoft.com`.

### Install

The MobSec CLI currently supports macOS, Debian based Linux distributions (Ubuntu), and Microsoft Windows (beta).  Below are the steps to install on each operating system:

1. Navigate to the  [Releases](https://github.com/khulnasoft/mobsec-platform-cli/releases) page and download the appropriate binary for your operating system/architecture (32 or 64bit).
2. Install based on your operating system:
   1. MacOS: Right click the .pkg file and select `run`.
   2. Linux: `sudo dpkg -i mobsec-cli_<VERSION>.deb`
   3. Window: Double-click `mobsec-cli_<VERSION>.exe`

### Configure

1. After the `mobsec-cli` has been installed on your system, run `mobsec-cli configure` to configure the CLI with your MobSec Platform Account.
2. The first prompt will ask you to enter the profile you are using. Hit enter to select the default profile of `default`. 

   **Note:** Most users will only need to use the default profile.  
3. The next prompt will ask you to enter the Platform API token that you will be using.  Paste this into the field provided  and hit enter.
4. The next prompt will ask you to enter the Graphql endpoint for MobSec Platform.  You can just hit enter if you are using the CLI to interact with the default production instance of MobSec Platform.  If you are using a single tenant deployment of MobSec Platform, you will need to enter the URL of your Graphql endpoint.  This URL will be in the format of `api.<tenant>.khulnasoft.com`.
5. The next prompt will ask you to enter the REST endpoint for MobSec Platform.  You can just hit enter if you are using the CLI to interact with the default production instance of MobSec Platform.  If you are using a single tenant deployment of MobSec Platform, you will need to enter the URL of your REST endpoint.  This URL will be in the format of `lab-api.<tenant>.khulnasoft.com`.
6. The next prompt and final will ask you to enter the UI Server for MobSec platform.  You can just hit enter if you are using the CLI to interact with the default production instance of MobSec Platform.  If you are using a single tenant deployment of MobSec Platform, you will need to enter the URL of your UI Server.  This URL will be in the format of `app.<tenant>.khulnasoft.com`.

Once done, verify that the CLI functions as expected by running `mobsec-cli app list`.  A listing of the apps in your platform account will be displayed.  If desired, you can run `mobsec-cli app list --json` to return the results in json format.  Example:

```bash
âœ— mobsec-cli app list
REF                                   TITLE                                       PLATFORM  PACKAGE                                                         GROUP

```
#### Windows Configuration Note

In some cases, the `mobsec-cli configure` will return "Error: N ot a valid token" when using CTRL-V to paste a valid token into the Windows Command or Powershell Prompt.  If this occurs, paste the token into the command prompt by using right click from your mouse.  When you do this, you should see asterisks to represent the token that is being submitted.  If this does not work, we recommend manually creating the `.nsclirc` file via the steps in the following section.



#### Manual Configuration of .nsclirc file

The `.nsclirc` file holds the configuration for the mobsec-cli.  If you want to manually configure this file, it should be created in the root of the user's home directory and should be named `.nsclirc` with no extensions (.txt, .env, etc).  The contents of this file should be configured as follows:

* `[Profile]`:  The mobsec-cli supports multiple profiles with the default profile being aptly named `[default]`.
* `token`: The token that you are using.
* `graphql` (optional): The graphql API endpoint that will be used.  This parameter is optional if you are using the default, https://api.khulnasoft.com.
* `rest`: (optional): The rest API endpoint that will be used.  This parameter is optional if you are using the default, https://lab-api.khulnasoft.com.
* `ui`: (optional): The URL to the UI that will be used.  THis parameter is optional if you are using the default, https://app.khulnasoft.com

Example of an .nsclirc file supporting a single profile using the default endpoints: 

```
[default]
token=eyJhbGciOiJFUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenwC
```
Example of an .nsclirc file supporting a single profile using single tenant endpoints:

```
[default]
token=eyJhbGciOiJFUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenTokenwC
graphql=https://api.st1.khulnasoft.com
rest=https://lab-api.st1.khulnasoft.com
ui=https://rainier.st1.khulnasoft.com
```
